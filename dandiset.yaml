description: "Calcium imaging experiments were performed on the clonal raider ant
  antennal lobe to determine whether odor coding is modulated during aging. Ants were
  either two weeks old or two months old, corresponding to nurse-like and forager-like
  behavioral patterns. Ants are clonal line B with transgene insert [ie-DsRed, ObirOrco-QF2,
  15xQUAS-GCaMP6s]. GCaMP6s labels all Orco-positive antennal lobe glomeruli and allows
  recording odor responses throughout the antennal lobe using volumetric imaging.\n
  \nAssociated with Hart et al. 2024. Pheromone representation in the ant antennal
  lobe changes with age. Current Biology 34. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.05.031\n
  \nAnts were stimulated with 5 general odorants (3-hexanone, isopropanol, ethanol,
  propionic acid, ethylpyrazine) and 2 alarm pheromones (4-methyl-3-heptanone and
  4-methyl-3-heptanol) all at either 3% or 48% concentration (volume/volume in paraffin
  oil). Experiments had a 3s lag time and a 5s stimulus time, total recording time
  48s, 0.83 volumes/second. 33 Z-planes were imaged in each volume.\n\nAnts were imaged
  on different days, and the following outline describes experiment conditions for
  the dataset.\n\nTwo weeks old experiment days:\n1-18-2023 - 48% odor conc.\n1-20-2023
  - 48% odor conc. \n2-24-2023 - 48% odor conc.\n1-17-2023 - 3% odor conc.\n\nTwo
  months old experiment days:\n1-10-2023 - 48% odor conc.\n4-6-2023 - 48% odor conc.\n
  1-11-2023 - 3% odor conc. \n"
